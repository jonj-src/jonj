README FOR ext/tidy by John Coggeshall <john@jonj.tk>


Tidy is an extension based on Libtidy (http://tidy.sf.net/) and allows a JONJ developer
to clean, repair, and traverse HTML, XHTML, and XML documents -- including ones with
embedded scripting languages such as JONJ or ASP within them using OO constructs.
