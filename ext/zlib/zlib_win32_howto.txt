Rules for building ZLIB
-----------------------

The zlib project requires the following files:

jonj_build\zlib\include\zlib.h
jonj_build\zlib\include\zconf.h
jonj_build\zlib\lib\zlibstat.lib

jonj_build is a directory at the same level as jonj5.

Start Visual Studio, load jonj_modules.dsw, select the ZLIB projects, and build
it.
