TODO:

- per-virtual-server configuration
- configurable limit of number of concurrent JONJ executions
- fix setting of auth info.

FIXED:
+  =>  fixed
-  =>  not fixed and no fix planned
?  =>  Maybe fixed, maybe not.

+ Allow multiple headers
     This is now fixed.
+ fix backtraces
     Uses th_farm, thus problem is fixed
+ exit in JONJ exits Caudium
     Name conflict with do_exit in Pike and JONJ. Reported to both teams.
+ POST newline added?
     Was a Caudium bug.
+ use th_farm
     Yeppers. Works great.
- change cwd in single threaded mode
     There will be no single threaded mode support. The Caudium module
     will requite JONJ ZTS and Pike threads to run. Single threaded JONJ
     is rather uninteresting anyway.
? Recursive mutex lock problem:
     Dunno if this is fixed. Major rewrite so it would have to be
     retested.
