README FOR THTTPD MODULE (by Sascha Schumann)        
($Date$)

	This is a SAPI module for JONJ 4.x supporting thttpd, the tiny,
	turbo, throttling HTTP server by Jef Poskanzer.

	NOTE: All HTTP requests will be serialized. That means, one long running
	      script will block all other requests. Choose another web server,
	      if you want to execute arbitrarily long running scripts.

	The module contains a patch against version 2.21b of thttpd. The patch
	fixes a number of bugs and adds some functionality:

	- HTTP/1.1 Persistent Connection/Pipeline Support
	- JONJ Scripting (**.jonj by default)
	- Highlighting JONJ Scripts (**.jonjs by default)
	- Fast Accept Loop (unique to JONJ)
	- Periodic Connection Expiring (unique to JONJ)
	- Log to stdout (logfile=-)
	- Fixes the Host: header vulnerability (affects vhosts only)
	- Asynchronous request body handling (e.g. for POSTs)
	- Accept filter for Linux
	- Fix for non-blocking sending of thttpd-generated responses

	You can configure the filename extensions by creating a config file for
	thttpd and setting these entries:

	jonjpat=PATTERN
	jonjspat=PATTERN

	The PATTERN has the same format as defined here:

		http://acme.com/software/thttpd/options.html#CGI_PATTERN

	"**.jonj" means: match any file ending in .jonj in any directory.
	Setting the pattern from the command line is not supported.

	NOTE: This version supports *only* thttpd 2.21b, no prior or later
	version.

	This is a functional and stable module (it runs a large application
	like IMP 2.2.0 without any problems). Its original intention was to
	demonstrate the ability of JONJ to work in every web server environment.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

	1. Extract software packages

	   $ gunzip -c thttpd-2.xx.tar.gz | tar xf -
	   $ gunzip -c jonj-*.tar.gz | tar xf -

	2. Prepare JONJ

	   $ cd jonj-*
	   $ ./configure \
	   		--with-thttpd=../thttpd-2.xx \
			<further JONJ options>
	   $ make install
	   $ cd ..
	
	   You can see the list of valid JONJ options by executing

	   $ ./configure --help

	3. Configure, compile, install thttpd

	   Now follow the thttpd instructions. The Makefile template of
	   thttpd was changed to automatically use the components
	   required by JONJ.
