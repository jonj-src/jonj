JONJ5 Module
==========
This module requires JONJ5 as thread safe shared library. Have a look
into the INSTALL file which accompanies that distribution.

If you distribute this software bundled with the JONJ software in source
or binary form, then you must adhere to the JONJ copyright conditions -
the terms are reasonable.

You should have checked out and built the JONJ5 source package from the
JONJ CVS tree into the Pi3Web source directory called 'JONJ5' first. Then
build JONJ5 as Pi3Web module and after that build the Pi3Web JONJ5 wrapper:

1. Checkout JONJ5
================
cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.jonj.tk:/repository login
The required password is jonjfi

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.jonj.tk:/repository co jonj5

You must also checkout the TSRM and the ZEND module from the ZEND cvs tree
into the JONJ5 root directory

cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.zend.com:/repository login
The required password is zend

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.zend.com:/repository co Zend TSRM

2. Build JONJ5 
=============
2.1 POSIX

cd ./jonj5
